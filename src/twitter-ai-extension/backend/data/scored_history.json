            "score": 0.4,
            "reason": "The answer offers a suggestion (smaller, more niche cycling community) which is somewhat helpful, but lacks depth or specific reasoning. It's a fairly generic piece of advice and doesn't demonstrate a strong understanding of the situation. The phrasing 'That sucks, sorry to hear it' is also a standard, low-value expression of sympathy."
