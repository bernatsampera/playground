    "question": "Tweet: Larry Ellison basically explained why OpenAI is positioned to win the AI race.\n\nToday’s models all trained on the same thing: public data. The internet. Books. Papers. General knowledge. Impressive, but capped.\n\nEllison’s point: peak value only comes when AI is trained on private data.\n\nThat’s where OpenAI is moving:\n• partnerships with universities to work with unpublished research\n• experts teaching models real job tasks, not just theory\n• deep access to how science, medicine, law, and finance actually work\n\nPublic data makes AI smart.\nPrivate data makes it decisive.\n\nThe next AI leap won’t come from reading more of the internet.\nIt’ll come from being invited behind the curtain.\n\nThat’s the real moat.\nHelper text: call bullshit",
