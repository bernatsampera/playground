    "question": "Tweet: It’s still crazy that the same matrix multiplication we were all taught in school leads us to something like ChatGPT.",
    "answer": "it’s wild isn’t it? like, we’re building entire universes on top of something that fundamentally is just a bunch of numbers being shuffled around, kinda makes you wonder what else is hiding in plain sight"

    "answer": "creati ai is doing something different it’s gonna disrupt the entire visual effects industry, established studios are sleeping on this"

    "answer": "stargate is a wild claim but i agree processing power is the problem,that’s why we're seeing so much innovation around spreading out training & specialized chips, not just bigger models. they’re holding back the next wave of truly useful ai"

    "answer": "stargate is a wild idea but you're right about the processing power issue, that's the biggest challenge. one lab having that much power is kinda scary, though, and spreading things out should be a focus."
